This project is a collective construction in Java of a database sistemy consult called CRM, a model that has been used in companies around the world.

The Iguana-Coding group work hard to organize the information in five models like the premises of Homework 2 (Lead, Opportunity, Account, Contacts and Products) and implement a mother class CRM to facilitate the user’s navigation.

In the CRM, the users will type a number or word to access the commands to find the information that is searching.
They could be able to create new leads, to convert leads in opportunities, to manage accounts, to control the product’s stock, to view up-to-date contacts and many other funcionalities. To access to them, they must indicate the option that they want.

Java Back End and JSON (database information) are the languages that you will find here. Carlos Orbegozo, Pau Guarch, Caleb González, Andrea Molinado and Aline Scarso are the authors of this project.
